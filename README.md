# Compound Interest Calculator

Imagine you just took out a loan to purchase a house. The compound interest for your loan will grow exponentially, not quadratically or geometrically.

For example, if you bought a home that cost $500,000 with a 3.0% interest rate (where interest is applied once per month) for a term of 25 years, you would pay $1,057,509.78 assuming your interest rate is fixed for the 30-year duration.
That is more than double the original amount â€” just from interest.

This Flask web app calculates the compound interest on a loan or investment based on user inputs: principal amount, interest rate, term (years), and compounds per year.
